# LCD-Backlight-Control-VEML7700-
Project is designed to automatically regulate the brightness of an DSI LCD display in embeded systems (or other Linux-based systems) using the VEML7700 ambient light sensor. The main Python script  runs as a background service and dynamically adjusts the screen brightness level based on the measured ambient Lux values.
